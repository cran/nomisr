# nomisr 0.3.0

## New features and function changes

* New `nomis_codelist()` function, which returns the internal coding for 
different concepts used by the NOMIS API in a \code{tibble}, given a dataset 
ID and a concept name. 

* The `additional_queries` parameter in `nomis_get_data()` and 
`nomis_get_metadata()` has been deprecated and will eventually be removed. 
Please use the `...` parameter for queries including concepts not available 
through the default parameters.

* The `sex` parameter in `nomis_get_data()` will also work with datasets that 
use "gender" instead of "sex".
